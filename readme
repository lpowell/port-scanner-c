OVERVIEW OF FUNCTIONS AND USAGE

This program has three methods of scanning addresses on a network. The default scan option will attempt every possible 10.x.x.x address on a network and report back if it can establish a connection. This takes a VERY long time. The full scan option will scan a given address to see if 14 of the most commonly attacked ports are open. This option also generates a report that will offer insight into the open ports and solutions to help keep them secure. The final scan type is the selected scan. This scan option will scan a given address for a given port and report back if it is open. 

Usage is ./Port-scan -[h,d,s,f,] -[a,p] [string]
-h will open a help menu 
-d signifies a default scan
-s signifies a select scan
-f signifies a full scan
-a designates an address to be used
-p designates a port to be used

Example usage 
Full scan
./Port-scan -f -a 10.0.0.1

Select scan
./Port-scan -s -a 10.0.0.1 -p 80

Default
./Port-scan -d
